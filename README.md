# live-web-code-editor

The Live Web Code Editor is a simple and efficient tool for developers to write, preview, and manage their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in real-time. This editor automatically saves the user's code to the browser's localStorage, ensuring that all changes are preserved even if the user refreshes the page or revisits it later. This feature eliminates the need to manually save the code and ensures continuity in the development process.
